# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

Employee Summary project by Nick Keller for DU full-stack web development bootcamp

# Functionality

For this project, we created a command line interface for a manager to enter employee information.
The information is then rendered to an html page so the manager can easily access it.

# Steps

1. We created classes for each role at the company, along with an Employee parent class.
2. We used inquirer to prompt questions to the manager.
3. Through inquirer choices, the manager can then choose to enter information for an employee and choose a role for said employee.
4. The information that is enter is then rendered to an html page using fs, path, the html templates for the corresponding employee (see templates directory), and the htmlRenderer.js javascript logic (see said file in lib directory).
5. The user can then see the outputted html by running the team.html rile in the output directory.
